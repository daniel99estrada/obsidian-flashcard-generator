Transport

Passive process
go with the concentration gradient, (not against it!) uses a helper, 

diffusion

osmosis 
is diffusion of water
selectively permeable membrane
low to high concentration( against the concentration gradient?)


effects of osmosis on cells
homolosis:
cells would be on hypotonic solution (solutions with a higher concentration)

Active transport
going against sconcetration gradient using ATP

sodium potassiom pump
moves ions out of the cell
polarity situation to do work, negative on one side, positive on the other
Sodiums out, potasium in

steps: 
carrier protein is attracted to sodium
ATP becomes ADP (phospate group is attached)
changes orientation and releases sodium
sodium is attracted to potasium
potasium is binded and relases something
changes orientation and releases potasium

Bulk Transport
huge quantities of material
taking stuff in: Endocytosis
exocytosis: release from the cell to the environment
