On September 11 2001 a series of coordinates attacks occurred in New York City. 

There were carried out by 19 members of the terrorist group [[al-Qaeda]].

Early in the morning, the American airlines flight 11 crashed into the North tower of the [[World Trace Center]]. Around 15 minutes later at 9:03, United Airlines' flight 175 crashed into the south tower of the [[World Trace Center]]. Both buildings collapsed due to the impact and the subsequent fire.

Around 30 minutes later, American Airlines flight 77 crashed into the [[Pentagon]] in Arlington Virginia. This attack caused several casualties and damaged the headquarters of The United state's [[Department of Defense]]

### Effects
The attacks led [[George W. Bush ]] to launch a military campaign known as [[The War on Terror]] against [[al-Qaeda]]. In 2011, a special forces operation killed [[Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan.

The [[Transportation Security Agency]] was created to enhance security at airports, and  [[Patriot Act]] was enacted, increasing the state's power to monitor and investigate.
